**`Why I decided to take a course in open source software development`**

The first time I heard about open source was probably because of Ubuntu. I kept hearing about it a lot ever since, but I’m one of those who think that posting a project on GitHub would refer to the open source activity. One more thing I know about it is that people around the world voluntarily participate in many projects to develop ideas together online, and those projects really help other people. I would like to become part of that commutity to make an impact on the world, so that is the reason I decided to take this course. I am excited to have a chance to learn what open source is through this course with professor Stewart Weiss.
